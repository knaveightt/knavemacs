* knavemacs-platform.el

This file is read at the very end of the init.el file, for any
platform or device specific configurations that need to be set before
Knavemacs can be used.

** Configurations

In the configurations folder, there are different .el files that
contain platform-specific configurations I may want to impose on my
configuration.

** Setting a Platform Configuration

Since it is knavemacs-platform.el that the init.el file is expecting,
all I need to do is copy over (i.e. overwrite) the
knavemacs-platform.el file in the platform folder, with one of the
platform-specific .el file in the configurations subdirectory. Make sure
the file in the platform folder is still named knavemacs-platform.el.

To revert back to the default configuration, just copy over the
default knavemacs-platform.el file in the configurations directory.
