* Knavemacs - Emacs Configuration
** What is it?
This is my emacs configuration, tested for **Emacs 30.2**.

It has been put together with heavy inspiration (sometimes overt copy and paste)
from a variety of sources, most notebly [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ][System Crafter's Emacs from Scratch]] and
[[https://github.com/LionyxML/emacs-solo][Emacs-Solo from LionyxML]]. Of course there are several additions and
customizations from myself as well. :)

Just ensure the ~init.el~ file is in the ~/.config/emacs folder, and ensure
the dependencies below are all met, then you should be good to go.

** Dependencies
The following dependencies must be met for this configuration to run properly:

- ~ripgrep~ must be installed
- ~JetBrainsMono~ Nerd Font must be installed
- included ~snippets~ folder moved to ~/Documents/data/snippets
- ensure included ~modal~ folder is in ~/.config/emacs
- Ensure the following items are created under ~/Documents/org/
  - notice.org
  - ticker.org
  - inbox.org
  - backlog.org
  - workstreams/ (note: this is a directory)
- consider running ~nerd-icons-instal-fonts~ once after loading emacs
- on linux, have a notification system installed (e.g. dunst)
