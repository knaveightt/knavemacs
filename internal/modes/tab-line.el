;; tab-line.el
;; Custom Tab Line Functionality - redefine how
;; the tab line is used.
;;
;; I use the tab-line as a way to "pin" buffers for quick
;; visiting, I have functions to pin / unpin buffers to the
;; tab line, as well as to cycle in a way that allows me
;; to quickly access the buffers that have been pinned to the
;; tab line. I can also call a function that allows me to
;; switch to a buffer that is represented on the tab line
;; only.
